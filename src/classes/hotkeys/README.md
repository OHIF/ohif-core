# Hotkeys

Hotkeys --> Call Commands (by name) CommandManager --> Finds best command using
command name and active contexts Runs command, returns result to hotkey?

// Hotkeys are really... Commands that CAN be bound to one or more keys // So we
can use the same identifier we use for commands?

// Extensions may try to register duplicate hotkey? // So we need a name. Just
don't overwrite on create? // Might be worth knowing which tools registered
which hotkeys?
